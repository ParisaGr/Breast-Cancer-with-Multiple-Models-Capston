## Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning
This project demonstrates various machine learning techniques using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The analysis includes data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the implementation of several machine learning models for cancer prediction. The model could serve as a useful tool for supporting medical diagnosis.

The purpose of this model is to predict whether a breast tumor is Benign (non-cancerous) or Malignant (cancerous). It does this by analyzing images taken from a breast tissue sample and looks at features such as:

Texture of cells - how smooth or rough the cells appear
Radius - the size of the cells
Symmetry - how uniform the cell shapes are
Concave points - how many indentations or "dips" are in the cell surface
Concavity - how deep these indentations are
Area - the total size of the cell clusters
This model can help with early detection of a potentially cancerous tumor. It can also act as a "second opinion" to help doctors make more accurate and speedy diagnoses with consistency.
